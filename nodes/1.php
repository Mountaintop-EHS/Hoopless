  <h1>Web Designer & Developer</h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm <b>Matt</b>. I love system design and development. I'm almost always smiling :).</p>
    <p>Currently, I'm developing primarily for Marlboro College but I got my start <?php echo (date('Y')-2002);?> years ago. Here's some of the projects I've worked on since then:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Helped to protect human health and the environment through designing and developing a complete chemical management, which is used in numerous manufacturing facilities across the Continental United States.</li>
      <li>Developed systems used to categorize, manage, and ship thousands of hazardous materials in accordance with state and federal regulations.</li>
      <li>Developed systems that accurately generate facility emission reports in accordance with site permits.</li>
      <li>Developed a system used to train and certifies employees in numerous regulatory requirements.</li>
      <li>Design a video game to help entertain children on the go.</li>
      <li>Evolved robotic systems that manufacturer metal decorative home decor.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>In my spare time I'm developing "<b>Hoopless</b>", a content management system used to run this any other websites. Oh, and I'm developing another game.</p>
