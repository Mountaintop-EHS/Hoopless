	<h2>The Problem</h2>
	<p>When developing a game engine you are essentially programming an entire world and defining the rules in which it operates. For my latest game engine, I wanted the effectiveness of each character's abilities to be determined based on their base stats. As each character grows more powerful, their base stats should improve in a manner that is related to their selected discipline which should be related to their actions. Different character types should be reliant on completely different base stats.  For example a warrior should be more reliant on strength than a healer. In addition, whenever any of a character's base stats (except luck) are equal to 0 the character should gain an affliction that prevents them from taking action. This is all part of my W.A.R. (wait, action, and recovery) engine.</p>
	<p>Based on this concept, I theorized the below listed stats and afflictions and coded the following class.</p>
